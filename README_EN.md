# Reall3dViewer

Reall3dViewer is a 3D Gaussian Splatting renderer built on Three.js. Crafting an exceptional renderer is no small feat, which is why we've chosen to open-source our project. We hope to harness the collective wisdom and efforts of the community to drive the advancement of 3DGS applications together!
